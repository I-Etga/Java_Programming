What if we call run method only ?
All the threads won't get executed in one time if we call RUN method. Threads gets executed after previous thread got executed COMPLETELY !!
If I modified my run method with "i", it shows in which order and how threads get executed !!
So if I want to thread get executed at the same exact time concretely, I have to call start() method.
If we call start method, run method gets executed as well.
