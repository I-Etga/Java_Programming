/*
8. Create a class named StockMarket:
        - Ask the user how many total shares they have already? (int)
            -> If the user gives 0 or give a negative number none of the rest condition should be executed

        - Ask the user how much their total value in the stock market is (double)
        - Ask the user to enter the name of the company they have the most shares in (String, multiple words)

        - Print in the following format:
            Ex:
                inputs: 100, 25000, Apple INC

            "Your total stock market holding is $25000 which is made up of 100 shares. Apple INC is your company holdings"
