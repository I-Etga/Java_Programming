        If I use void setInfo method I would have to call that method every single time I created object.
        But constructor gets executed right away with creating a new object. No need another set method.

         We use constructor with parameter. So this is from now on mandatory to pass argument.
         Otherwise, we can't create any objects from this class.

         allows us to set all the instance variables of the object as soon as the object Ä±s created.*/
